  <h1 id="Heading">My Interest</h1> 
   <article>
        <p> I am interested in anything that is interesting. Eclecticity seeps into my brain much more easily than the thunderingly similar data of a single concentrated topic area. Though I tend to gravitate towards <em>computer, science, and math information,</em> I will just as likely find an article on a <b>political, religious, or historical </b>topic just as interesting as an article on how astronauts keep their Coke fizzy in space or a book on how public key encryption works. </p>

        <p>My interests are gauged by how much time I spend in each of them. I spend time on my personal relationship with <i>God (greatest interest) studying, programming, writing, playing cricket, cycling and watching movies</i> in order. </p>

        <p>Though I do not spend most of my daily time actively engaging in monastic exercises of personal study and reflection, or even in what would popularly be considered religious activity, I have determined to mold my entire life, moment by moment, in a way that is pleasing to God. This is my greatest interest.</p> 

        <p>The second-most done activity in my life is programming, as it is currently my passion. I do try to spend some time off the clock exercising this interest, but if allowed free in the wild, it would probably take third place to the next interest: writing. </p>

        <h2> Favourite Food</h2>
            <p>I am very foodie. I love to eat and cook. The food gives us energy. Without food, there is no life. There are so many dishes available in todayâ€™s world some like Indian foods like Biryani, Dosa, Pav Bhaji, Pani Puri etc whereas some like western foods like Pizza, Burger, Noodles etc. But my most favourite foods are:</p>
             <ul>
            <li class="list">Mashrafe Mortaza </li>
            <li class="list">Shakib Al Hasan </li>
            <li class="list">Mushfiqur Rahim </li>
            <li class="list">Mahmudullah </li>
            <li class="list">Mustafizur Rahman </li>

        </ul>
        
        </div>

            Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.

        My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my younger brother in the back side of my home.
        Some of my favorite cricketers are;
            <ol>
            <li class="list"> Philip Larkin</li>
            <li class="list"> Sylvia Plath</li>
            <li class="list"> Mary Oliver</li>
            <li class="list"> Marge Piercy</li>
            <li class="list"> Mark Doty</li>
            <li class="list"> Margaret Atwood</li>
        </ol>
       
        </div>

        <p>When I have time to ride my bicycle, I do. At one point, I used to actively train and race, when I came out of obesity and worked more diligently on my physique than I am now.</p>

         <div> 
            <p>I watch movie when I get time. It relaxs my mind. Having movie night at least once a month is a great way to socialize with friends and catch up on a favorite movie.</p>
            <h3>Some of my favourite movies are:</h3>
